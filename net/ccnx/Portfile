description             ProjectCCNx implementation of Content Centric Networking (CCN) / \
                        Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture

long_description        Project CCNx(r) exists to develop, promote, and evaluate a new \
                        approach to communication architecture we call content-centric \
                        networking.  We seek to carry out this mission by creating and \
                        publishing open protocol specifications and an open source \
                        software reference implementation of those protocols.  We provide \
                        support for a community of people interested in experimentation, \
                        research, and building applications with this technology, all \
                        contributing to its evolution.
